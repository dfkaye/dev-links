  - > \[Gatsby\] was my first experience with React, and I hated it. It was so complicated to do just tiny bits of functionality.
  - > If you can live without GraphQL, Next.js will do everything Gatsby does and more.
  - > \[S\]lightly inclined to Next.js over Gatsby... The top feature for me is the file-based routing that also supports dynamic routes and compatibility with Sourcebit, which allows me to switch the data source or SSG any way I want in the future without reimplementing everything from scratch.
