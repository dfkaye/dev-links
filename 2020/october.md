+ Ondrej Polesny (2020), **Why is Next.js my ultimate choice over Gatsby, Gridsome, and Nuxt?** &#8594; https://kontent.ai/blog/gatsby-vs-next-gridsome-nuxt
  - > \[Gatsby\] was my first experience with React, and I hated it. It was so complicated to do just tiny bits of functionality.
  - > If you can live without GraphQL, Next.js will do everything Gatsby does and more.
  - > \[S\]lightly inclined to Next.js over Gatsby... The top feature for me is the file-based routing that also supports dynamic routes and compatibility with Sourcebit, which allows me to switch the data source or SSG any way I want in the future without reimplementing everything from scratch.

## The Ugly Side of TypeScript

+ Dave Schinkel (2020), **Including Custom TypeScript Declaration files with Mocha.js** &#8594; https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/including-custom-typescript-declaration-files-mochajs-dave-schinkel/
  - > I use TypeScript for tests and production code for my site WeDoTDD.com, however I'm not a big fan of it because it becomes pretty cumbersome to maintain it and to continually make TypeScript "happy" in my opinion.
