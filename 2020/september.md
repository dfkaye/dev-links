## User Safety

  - @andershovmoller does an excellent, succint job describing an unsafe state in an application and affording the user a way back to a safe state.

## Algorithms

  - follow-up to **You Might Not Need the Virtual DOM** &#8594; https://blog.functorial.com/posts/2018-03-12-You-Might-Not-Need-The-Virtual-DOM.html
  - Quote from Cai, Giarrusso, Rendel and Ostermann (2013), **A Theory of Changes for Higher-Order Languages (PDF)** &#8594; https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0658:
    > If the result of an expensive computation is invalidated by a small change to the input, the old result should be updated incrementally instead of reexecuting the whole computation.
