## CSS

+ Gallagher Website Design (blog, date unknown), **Remove `<br>` Line Break with CSS and Replace with Space** &#8594; https://www.gallagherwebsitedesign.com/blog/remove-line-break-css-replace-with-space/
  - Sure came in handy
+ Louis Hoebregts (2018), **The trick to viewport units on mobile** &#8594; https://css-tricks.com/the-trick-to-viewport-units-on-mobile/
  - and why mobile browser vendors do not define viewport units reliably
+ Sergey Chikuyonok (2016), **CSS GPU Animation: Doing It Right** &#8594; https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/gpu-animation-doing-it-right/
  - animate with `transform` instead of `left` so that the animation is no longer bound to the CPU - and doesn't cause reflow calculations (too many cause iOS Safari to crash)
+ Keir Watson (2020), **Responsive grid layout in 20 lines of CSS** &#8594; https://css-tricks.com/responsive-grid-magazine-layout-in-just-20-lines-of-css/

## HTML

+ Scott Vinkle (2020), **How Does HTML Microdata Help With Accessibility?** &#8594; https://scottvinkle.me/blogs/blog/how-html-microdata-helps-with-accessibility
+ Robin Rendle (2017), **An Idea for a Simple Responsive Spreadsheet** &#8594; https://css-tricks.com/idea-simple-responsive-spreadsheet/
+ Chris Coyier (2020), **A Complete Guide to Links and Buttons** &#8594; https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-links-and-buttons/

## JavaScript

+ Lennard Schutter (2019), *nice stackoverflow answer to, **How to parameterize mocha tests "@theory" style?*** &#8594; https://stackoverflow.com/a/54245338
+ Kent C. Dodds (2019), **"React is all you need to manage application state"** &#8594; https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react
+ Fiona Hopkins (2018), **Deciphering TypeScriptâ€™s React errors** &#8594; https://medium.com/innovation-and-technology/deciphering-typescripts-react-errors-8704cc9ef402
  - I hate React, but I *really* hate TypeScript; favoring types over tests solves nothing.
+ Josh W. Comeau (2020), **The Perils of Rehydration**: An Eye-Opening Realization about Gatsby and React &#8594; https://joshwcomeau.com/react/the-perils-of-rehydration#the-solution
  - I also hate Gatsby; *it is not a "static site generator" but a SPA generator*; its reliance on React breaks dynamic vanilla JavaScript loading so you have to use `dangerouslySetInnerHtml()`; fanboyz are only lately admitting this, now that the Gatsby team has decided to take the VC money; the predictable result will be yet another Frankenstein framework/app.
  
## Testing

+ Gleb Bahmutov (2019), **Stop using Page Objects and Start using App Actions** &#8594;  https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/01/03/stop-using-page-objects-and-start-using-app-actions/#page-objects-problems

  - includes react- and jest-specific stuff, too.
