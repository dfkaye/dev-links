+ Sergey Chikuyonok (2016), **CSS GPU Animation: Doing It Right** &#8594; https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/gpu-animation-doing-it-right/
  - animate with `transform` instead of `left` so that the animation is no longer bound to the CPU - and doesn't cause reflow calculations (too many can cause iOS Safari to crash)
+ Keir Watson (2020), **Responsive grid layout in 20 lines of CSS** &#8594; https://css-tricks.com/responsive-grid-magazine-layout-in-just-20-lines-of-css/

## JavaScript

+ Josh W. Comeau (2020), **The Perils of Rehydration** &#8594; https://joshwcomeau.com/react/the-perils-of-rehydration#the-solution
  - I also hate Gatsby; *it is not a static site generator but a SPA generator*; its reliance on React (`dangerouslySetHtml()`) breaks dynamic vanilla JavaScript loading; fanboyz are only lately admitting this, now that the Gatsby team has decided to take the VC money, which result in build another Frankenstein.
