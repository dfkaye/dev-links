## Getting beyond process

  1.) If you were going to build a piece of social software to support large and long-lived groups, what would you design for? The first thing you would design for is handles the user can invest in.
  1.) Second, you have to design a way for there to be members in good standing... some way in which good works get recognized
  1.) Three, you need barriers to participation
  1.) ...you have to find a way to spare the group from scale. Scale alone kills conversations, because conversations require dense two-way conversations

  > Deploying something useless into production, as soon as you can... pulls unknown risk forward, opens up parallel streams of work, and establishes good habits.
+ Ted Dziuba (2011), on how to produce good software - http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2011/12/process.html
  > policies and procedures irritate top performers, and are just more grievances on their list that will some day metastasize into a resignation letter. (Side note: if someone keeps such a list, there's a high probability they are a top performer.
  + Rule 1: Resist Process from the Start
  + Rule 2: Grow Headcount as a Last Resort
  + Rule 3: Use The GitHub Workflow (And Other Good Stuff)
  + Rule 4: Just Let Go

## Architecture
+ Aza Raskin (2109), You Are Solving The Wrong Problem - http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/the-wrong-problem/
  > When you are solving a difficult problem re-ask the problem so that your solution helps you learn faster. Find a faster way to fail, recover, and try again. If the problem you are trying to solve involves creating a magnum opus, you are solving the wrong problem.
+ Adam Dymitruk @adymitruk (2019), Event Modeling: What is it? - https://eventmodeling.org/posts/what-is-event-modeling/
  > ... Event Modeling only uses 3 moving pieces and 4 patterns based on 2 ideas. It takes a few minutes to explain and the rest of the learning is done in practice, transparently where any deficiencies in the understanding of even those few core ideas are quickly corrected.
