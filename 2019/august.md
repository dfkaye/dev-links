## Designing Safer Systems

+ Matthew Parker (2018), Starting Out with TLA+ - https://codingagainstchaos.com/2018/06/04/starting-out-with-tla.html
  > A programming language tells a computer how to do something. A specification language focuses on what the programmer wants to do. TLA+ is not executable and is not meant for translation.
+ Richard Cook (2000), How Complex Systems Fail (pdf) - https://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf
  > Safety is a characteristic of systems and not of their components
+ Jared Spool (2109), Consistency in Design is the Wrong Approach - https://medium.com/@jmspool/consistency-in-design-is-the-wrong-approach-3cfbc87a327
  > Current Knowledge \[user's perspective] is a much better way to think about the problem.*
+ W. Ross Ashby (1958), Requisite variety and its implications for the control of complex systems - http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/AshbyReqVar.pdf - specifically, short article by the originator on *The Law of Requisite Variety*...
  > ...consider  whether  a  regulation which  is  excessively  difficult  to  design when  it  is  controlled  by  error  may  not  be  easier  to  design if  it is  controlled  not  by the error but by what gives rise to the error.
+ Nancy Leveson (2004), A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems - http://sunnyday.mit.edu/accidents/safetyscience-single.pdf - *a model based on systems theory*
  > Instead of defining safety management in terms of preventing component failure events, it isdefined as a continuous control task to impose the constraints necessary to limit system behavior tosafe changes and adaptations.


## Designing Useful Systems

+ Joel Spolsky (2001), In Defense of Not-Invented-Here Syndrome - https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/10/14/in-defense-of-not-invented-here-syndrome/
  > “Find the dependencies — and eliminate them.”
  > If it’s a core business function — do it yourself, no matter what.
+ Steve Yegge (2008),  Business Requirements are Bullshit - http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/08/business-requirements-are-bullshit.html
  > We're not talking about a *failure mode* for Gathering Business Requirements (GBR). We're talking about something more fundamental: the GBR phase of a project is a leading indicator that the project will fail.
