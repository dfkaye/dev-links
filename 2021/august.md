### Colors

+ Ahmad Shadeed (2021), **Using HSL Colors In CSS** &#8594; https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/hsl-colors-css/
    > HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Itâ€™s based on the RGB color wheel. Each color has an angle and a percentage value for the saturation and lightness values.


### Graph Programming

+ Uri Valevski (2020), **Graph Programming** &#8594; https://www.hyro.ai/post/graph-programming
    > This work presents the notion of graph programming, a way to program by building graphs of functions from connecting pairs of functions in a non-enclosing way, and aims to replace typical function composition.


### Requirements Engineering

+ Michael Jastram and Andreas Kara (2016), **Modeling Requirements with Constraints** &#8594; https://re-magazine.ireb.org/articles/modeling-requirements-with-constraints
  + **Find of the Month!** Reached this when I searched for "constraint modeling" after reading Nancy Leveson's [A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/accidents/safetyscience-single.pdf), specifically section **3.1 The Central Role of Constraints in System Safety**, which begins:
      > The most basic concept in the new model is not an event, but a constraint. In systems theory,
      control is always associated with the imposition of constraints. The cause of an accident, instead
      of being understood in terms of a series of events, is viewed as the result of a lack of constraints
      imposed on the system design and on operations, that is, by inadequate enforcement of constraints
      on behavior at each level of a socio-technical system. In systems theory terminology, safety is
      an emergent property that arises when the system components interact within an environment.
      Emergent properties are controlled or enforced by a set of constraints (control laws) related to the
      behavior of the system components. Accidents result from a lack of appropriate constraints on the
      interactions.
