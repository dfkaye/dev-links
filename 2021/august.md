### Find of the Month!

+ Michael Jastram and Andreas Kara (2016), **Modeling Requirements with Constraints** &#8594; https://re-magazine.ireb.org/articles/modeling-requirements-with-constraints
  + Refactored activity diagram looks very much like the reactive loop model in the SAM pattern where actions and/or mutations are constrained by acceptors and/or next-action predicates.
  + Reached this when I searched for "constraint modeling" after reading Nancy Leveson's [A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/accidents/safetyscience-single.pdf), specifically section **3.1 The Central Role of Constraints in System Safety**, which begins:
      > The most basic concept in the new model is not an event, but a constraint. In systems theory,
      control is always associated with the imposition of constraints. The cause of an accident, instead
      of being understood in terms of a series of events, is viewed as the result of a lack of constraints
      imposed on the system design and on operations, that is, by inadequate enforcement of constraints
      on behavior at each level of a socio-technical system. In systems theory terminology, safety is
      an emergent property that arises when the system components interact within an environment.
      Emergent properties are controlled or enforced by a set of constraints (control laws) related to the
      behavior of the system components. Accidents result from a lack of appropriate constraints on the
      interactions.

### Async state

+ Yves Goeleven (2021), **Client side Event sourcing** &#8594; https://www.goeleven.com/blog/client-side-event-sourcing/
  + On moving server-side logic (CQRS architecture, cache aside pattern, store and forward pattern) to the client to allow a user to work offline, for extended amounts of time.
+ Craig Buckler (2021), **How to Use IndexDB to Manage State in JavaScript** &#8594; https://blog.openreplay.com/how-to-use-indexdb-to-manage-state-in-javascript
+ Surma (2019), **When should you be using Web Workers?** &#8594; https://surma.dev/things/when-workers/
  + > You should always use Web Workers.
+ Eric Bower (2019), **Simplify testing async I/O in javascript** &#8594; https://erock.io/2019/04/12/simplify-testing-async-io-javascript.html
    - Uses his [cofx](https://github.com/neurosnap/cofx) which "is a way to declaratively write asynchronous IO code in a synchronous way. It leverages the flow control of generators and makes testing even the most complex async IO relatively straight forward," and his [gen-tester](https://github.com/neurosnap/gen-tester), "a small \[nicer] API for testing generators."
    - **Unfortunately, both are written in TypeScript.**

### Browser

+ Ahmad Shadeed (2021), **Using HSL Colors In CSS** &#8594; https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/hsl-colors-css/
    > HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. It’s based on the RGB color wheel. Each color has an angle and a percentage value for the saturation and lightness values.

+ Jason Grigsby (2016), **Autofill: What web devs should know, but don’t** &#8594; https://cloudfour.com/thinks/autofill-what-web-devs-should-know-but-dont/

### Oddities

+ Uri Valevski (2020), **Graph Programming** &#8594; https://www.hyro.ai/post/graph-programming
    > This work presents the notion of graph programming, a way to program by building graphs of functions from connecting pairs of functions in a non-enclosing way, and aims to replace typical function composition.
+ Steven Wittens (2021), **Headless React** &#8594; https://acko.net/blog/live-headless-react/
  + Neither a typo, redundancy, nor oxymoron.
  + Site is nifty with a lot of cool CSS and other effects, plus deep dive posts on programming structure.
