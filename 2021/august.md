### Requirements Engineering

  + Find of the month after reading Nancy Leveson's [A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/accidents/safetyscience-single.pdf), specifically section **3.1 The Central Role of Constraints in System Safety**, which begins:

    > The most basic concept in the new model is not an event, but a constraint. In systems theory,
    control is always associated with the imposition of constraints. The cause of an accident, instead
    of being understood in terms of a series of events, is viewed as the result of a lack of constraints
    imposed on the system design and on operations, that is, by inadequate enforcement of constraints
    on behavior at each level of a socio-technical system. In systems theory terminology, safety is
    an emergent property that arises when the system components interact within an environment.
    Emergent properties are controlled or enforced by a set of constraints (control laws) related to the
    behavior of the system components. Accidents result from a lack of appropriate constraints on the
    interactions.
