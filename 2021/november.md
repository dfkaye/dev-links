  1. Developers should create or update libraries and their documentation to assume re-entrancy by default.
  2. A library is not considered high-quality unless it is idempotent. Developers should be able to initialize and destroy an instance many times during a single browser page context, including releasing event handlers and cleaning up/preparing the DOM state for caching during an unload event.
  3. The most celebrated libraries will be atomic, making as few assumptions about DOM structure or CSS framework as possible while allowing several simultaneous instances of the library on a page.

  + ARIA-first development is an anti-pattern, not as maintainable as using semantic HTML, can override native semantics, and is not fully supported by all assistive technologies anyway.
