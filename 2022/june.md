## Railway-oriented programming

Prompted by Wes Bos tweet -- https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1536720926112460801

+ Abiodun Olowode (2021), **Railway Oriented Programming In Rails Using Dry-Monads** &#8594; https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/railway-programming-dry-monads/
  + **Best post** with examples of actual Rails functions and *RSpec tests*!
+ name (2020), **Asynchronous Functions and the Railway Oriented Programming Pattern** &#8594; https://www.jonminter.dev/posts/railway-oriented-programming-async/
+ Scott Wlaschin (2019), **Against Railway-Oriented Programming** *(when used thoughtlessly)* &#8594; https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/against-railway-oriented-programming/
+ Victor Jonah (@Vectormike_) (2020), **What is railway oriented programming?** &#8594; https://blog.logrocket.com/what-is-railway-oriented-programming/
  + While Wlaschin coined the term ROP in 2014, I think this introduction more accessible.
