    - One of the first - and enthusiastic - responses to the 2012 article by David Harel, Assaf Marron, and Gera Weiss on **Behavioral Programming** &#8594; https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/7/151241-behavioral-programming/fulltext

## Combinators

+ Donnacha Oisín Kidney (2020), **Fun with Combinators** &#8594; https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2020-10-17-ski.html
    - some implementation logic for lambda calculus with combinators

## Flux pattern

+ Andrew Ray (2021), **The Mental Model That Helped Me Finally Understand "Flux"** &#8594; https://andrewray.me/blog/the-mental-model-that-helped-me-finally-understand-flux
    - Originally published 2014, updated and re-styled 2021, post describes one-way data flow pattern recommended in the early days of ReactJS. 
    - This was easier to follow in 2021, my having worked with both Redux.js and the SAM pattern.

## Generators 

+ Ryan De La Torre (2021), **Codepen: Generators as State Machines** &#8594; https://codepen.io/rgdelato/pen/vGNRqP
    - SAM pattern friend shows skills with generator functions.

## Locally Testable Codes

+ Mordechai Rorvig (2021), **Researchers Defeat Randomness to Create Ideal Code** &#8594; https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-defeat-randomness-to-create-ideal-code-20211124/
    > By carefully constructing a multidimensional and well-connected graph, a team of researchers has finally created a long-sought locally testable code that can immediately betray whether it’s been corrupted.
    > To create an optimal method for encoding information, researchers represented it in a graph that takes the form of a richly interconnected web of booklets that explodes outward. Each square in the graph represents one single bit of information from a message.
    - Presentation by Irit Dinur (Weizmann Institute of Science) at UC Berkeley, (Oct. 2021), **Breakthroughs — Locally Testable Codes with Constant Rate, Distance, and Locality** &#8594; https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/breakthroughs-locally-testable-codes-constant-rate-distance-and-locality

    - Wow! An actual study of PBT focusing how students learn PBT and where they struggle (reuirement of independent subproperties).
+ James Sinclair (2021), **How not to write property tests in JavaScript** &#8594; https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2021/how-not-to-write-property-tests-in-javascript/
    > How do we keep ourselves from over-specifying or writing unnecessary tests?

## Reactivity

+ Ryan Carniato (2021), **The Quest for ReactiveScript ** &#8594; https://dev.to/this-is-learning/the-quest-for-reactivescript-3ka3
