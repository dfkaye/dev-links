## Functional UI

*We still need to fix something in the SAM architecture claim that "the view is a function of the model", because the view is too easily confused with "the UI" vs. its representation. It is more correct to say that the view depends on a representation which is a function of the model.*

*The following deal with view-as-UI, but `raj` really offers something close to SAM: side-effects (that is, mutations to the view and possibly other actions) as first-class citizens.*
