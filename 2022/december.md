## Find of the Month

+ David Unger (2009), **Self and Self: Whys and Wherefores** &#8594; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ka4KY7TMTU
  - Hour-long video on the development of the *Self* programming environment.

## everything is distributed

+ Manuel Odendahl (2022), **Embedded programming is like web development** &#8594; https://the.scapegoat.dev/embedded-programming-is-like-web-development/#web-and-embedded-software-engineering-is-remarkably-similar

## maybe, maybe not

+ `Syncpup` (2022), **‘Let It Crash’ under attack** &#8594; http://blog.syncpup.com/posts/let-it-crash-under-attack.html
  - Consternation at Syncpup over unit tests for Erlang feels like a form of "I'm just asking questions" move-fast-and-break-things garbage. 
+ Aaron Hedges (2016), **Coroutines** &#8594; https://dashron.com/posts/coroutines
  - explains his javascript library for creating coroutines
  - 2022: library is deprecated, recommends async/await instead...
+ James Long (2014), **Taming the Asynchronous Beast with CSP Channels in JavaScript** &#8594; https://archive.jlongster.com/Taming-the-Asynchronous-Beast-with-CSP-in-JavaScript
  - Probably a re-post by me. Another, longer take on coroutines and channels with his own javascript library (no activity since 2016), a fork of another one now 5 years in maintenance mode...
