## Find of the Month

+ David Unger (2009), **Self and Self: Whys and Wherefores** &#8594; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ka4KY7TMTU
  - Hour-long video on the development of the *Self* programming environment.

## everything is distributed

+ Manuel Odendahl (2022), **Embedded programming is like web development** &#8594; https://the.scapegoat.dev/embedded-programming-is-like-web-development/#web-and-embedded-software-engineering-is-remarkably-similar

## proofs

+ Jim Fisher (2022), **Proofs about programs** &#8594; https://busy-beavers.tigyog.app/proofs-about-programs

## accessibility

+ maxdesign (2022), **Methods of applying accessible names to elements** &#8594; https://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/accessible-name.html

## design

+ Jesse Duffield (2022), **Read This Post 'Unless' You're Not A Ruby Developer** &#8594; https://jesseduffield.com/Unless/
  > I don't like Ruby's `unless` keyword...\[which] is just syntactic sugar for `if !`
+ Jesse's follow-up: **Don't Read This Follow-up Post 'Unless' You ARE A Non-Ruby Developer** &#8594; https://jesseduffield.com/Unless-Responses/
  > Reading through the comments on the post it's now clear to me that there really are two sizable, incompatible cohorts of people, and one of the two has to just suck it up and deal with the fact that the other cohortâ€™s preferences won the day.

## HTMHell

*HTMHell is organized by Manuel Matuzovic &#8594; https://www.matuzo.at/.*

My favorite entries from HTMHell's Advent Calendar 2022 series:

+ Frederik Braun (2022), **DOM Clobbering** &#8594; https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2022/12/
+ Saptak Sengupta (2022), **Using SRI to protect from malicious JavaScript** &#8594; https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2022/3/
  - SRI means sub-resource integrity

## maybe

+ Mark Wylde (2022), **Show HN: Run unsafe user generated JavaScript in the browser** &#8594; https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33673047
  - includes link to Mark's solution, **workerbox** &#8594; https://github.com/markwylde/workerbox
+ `Syncpup` (2022), **'Let It Crash' under attack** &#8594; http://blog.syncpup.com/posts/let-it-crash-under-attack.html
  - Consternation at Syncpup over unit tests for Erlang feels like a form of "I'm just asking questions" move-fast-and-break-things garbage.

## maybe not

+ Aaron Hedges (2016), **Coroutines** &#8594; https://dashron.com/posts/coroutines
  - explains his javascript library for creating coroutines
  - 2022: library is deprecated, recommends async/await instead...
+ James Long (2014), **Taming the Asynchronous Beast with CSP Channels in JavaScript** &#8594; https://archive.jlongster.com/Taming-the-Asynchronous-Beast-with-CSP-in-JavaScript
  - Probably a re-post by me. Another, longer take on coroutines and channels with his own javascript library (no activity since 2016), a fork of another one now 5 years in maintenance mode...
