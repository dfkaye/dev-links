## Ignorance

**One reason most web developers don't know anything while asserting everything is that they spend all their time writing instead of reading.**

While feeling his way toward a theory of data, George H. Mealy, in 1967, wrote this about programming languages:

"[W]hat we really need is fewer data types along with apparatus which will allow the user to define his own [data type]."

Barbara Liskov and Steven Zilles referred to this paper in their own in 1974, Programming with Abstract Data Types,

which they follow up with Specification Techniques for Data Abstractions, 1975

### Cancelable Promise

+ Pierre-Yves GÃ©rardy (2016), **You can already cancel ES6 Promises** &#8594; https://gist.github.com/pygy/6290f78b078e22418821b07d8d63f111
  - Cancelable promise implementation with links to others in the comments.
  - However, promises represent values rather than actions.
  - Values can't be "cancelled" but actions can (so long as they haven't yet completed).
  - Values can be awaited, but actions... and here the semantics of the terminology breaks down.
  - Suppose we await values from a stream of values. Is the stream a value?
  - OK, stop it. The stream is not the values it sends, but is its own value.
  - An action is its own value.
  - We don't cancel streams, we stop listening to them, or unsubscribe.
  - Which is to say, *we cancel our subscriptions to them*.
  - async/await makes directly cancelling or unsubscribing from promises impossible.
  - Keep working on the distinction between `await promise` and `await value`...
