## Atrocity Exhibition

+ Richard Gabriel (2002), **Objects have failed** &#8594; https://www.dreamsongs.com/ObjectsHaveFailedNarrative.html
  - From 20 years ago this essay captures the essence of smashmouth, in-your-face, non-cooperation that has infected "software" "engineering" as now pushed by "entrepeneurs" and "technology saviors".
  - The truth is all this is driven by the obsessive fixation with static types.
+ Brett Slatkin (2022), **The case for dynamic, functional programming** &#8594; https://www.onebigfluke.com/2022/11/the-case-for-dynamic-functional.html
  - All the problems with objects yoked to static types in the Gabriel essay melt away in this one.
  > Similar to how dynamic languages don't require you to "emulate the compiler" in your head, purely functional languages don't require you to "emulate the state machine". Functional languages reduce the need to reason about time and state changes.
+ BÃ¨r Kessels (2022), **Using a Framework will harm the maintenance of your software** &#8594; https://berk.es/2022/09/06/frameworks-harm-maintenance/
  - Same goes for frameworks, which are "designed to take your project hostage'.
