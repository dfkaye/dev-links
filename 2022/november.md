## Find of the Month

+ Greg Young (2014), **The art of destroying software** &#8594; https://vimeo.com/108441214
  - 40-minute video of Greg's talk promoting "deletability" as part of software design.
  - That is, you should be able to delete it and start over *without fear*.

## Atrocity Exhibition

+ Richard Gabriel (2002), **Objects have failed** &#8594; https://www.dreamsongs.com/ObjectsHaveFailedNarrative.html
  - From 20 years ago this essay captures the essence of smashmouth, in-your-face, non-cooperation that has infected "software" "engineering" as now pushed by "entrepeneurs" and "technology saviors".
  - The truth is all this is driven by the obsessive fixation with static types.
+ Brett Slatkin (2022), **The case for dynamic, functional programming** &#8594; https://www.onebigfluke.com/2022/11/the-case-for-dynamic-functional.html
  - All the problems with objects yoked to static types in the Gabriel essay melt away in this one.
  > Similar to how dynamic languages don't require you to "emulate the compiler" in your head, purely functional languages don't require you to "emulate the state machine". Functional languages reduce the need to reason about time and state changes.
+ Bèr Kessels (2022), **Using a Framework will harm the maintenance of your software** &#8594; https://berk.es/2022/09/06/frameworks-harm-maintenance/
  - Same goes for frameworks, which are "designed to take your project hostage'.

## Web components

Liberation from framework dependency lock-in starts with custom elements, or "web components".

+ Craig Buckler (2022), **An introduction to native web components** &#8594; https://blog.openreplay.com/an-introduction-to-native-web-components/
+ Danny Moerkerke (2022), **The Hidden Power of Custom States For Web Components** &#8594; https://itnext.io/the-hidden-power-of-custom-states-for-web-components-dcae5b048e20
  - You can use element internals to define a custom element's own custom states (AKA pseudo-classes sucha as `:checked`, `:disabled`, `:hover`)!

## Offline web components

+ Yves Goeleven (2021), **Building offline Progressive Web Apps** &#8594; https://www.goeleven.com/guides/building-offline-progressive-web-apps/
  - Landing page and overview for the PWA philosophy. A *lot* of links to other articles Yves has written, such as...
+ Yves Goeleven (2022), **Task oriented user interfaces** &#8594; https://www.goeleven.com/blog/task-oriented-user-interfaces/
  - show only relevant state
  - show related tasks
  - form for each task
  - show appropriate feedback
  - create multiple small apps

## Element design

Think of elements as whole applications.

+ Christian Holst (2011), **Redesigning The Country Selector** &#8594; https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/redesigning-the-country-selector/
  - From *2011*, a select element made dynamic for country names, with a demo at https://baymard.com/labs/country-selector.
+ Adam Silver (2022), **Designing a time input** &#8594; https://adamsilver.io/blog/designing-a-time-input/
  - Why using a single text input is the best approach.

## Accessibility

+ @components_ai (2022), **Accessible Color Combinations** &#8594; https://randoma11y.com/
  - Nice online tool for generating accessible foreground-background color combinations.
+ @h_locke (2020), **Why 'dark mode' causes more accessibility issues than it solves** &#8594; https://scribe.rip/@h_locke/why-dark-mode-causes-more-accessibility-issues-than-it-solves-d2f8359bb46a
  - Because of the "halation effect" caused by *astigmatism* which affects 47% of the population...
  > TLDR — dark mode makes astigmatism worse.

## CSS and forms

+ Jen Simmons (2022), **Using `:has()` as a CSS Parent Selector and much more** &#8594; https://webkit.org/blog/13096/css-has-pseudo-class/
  - See in particular, [Styling form states without JS](https://webkit.org/blog/13096/css-has-pseudo-class/#styling-form-states-without-js).

## Everything is a list

+ @antirez (2022), **In defense of linked lists** &#8594; http://antirez.com/news/138
  - Linked lists are educational, augmentable, useful, simple, conceptual
