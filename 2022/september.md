  + *An event has two features: it has already happened and it is relevant to the business*
  + *A command is a directive to do something that hasn’t happened yet*
  + *Commands only have one receiver: the code that does the work the command wants done*
  + *\[E\]vents will be consumed by multiple subscribers...*
  + *Because there can be many places subscribing to the event, modifying the event can have a large ripple effect through multiple different systems*
