+ [Transition system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_system) - differ from finite state automata in several ways:
    - The set of states is not necessarily finite, or even countable.
    - The set of transitions is not necessarily finite, or even countable.
    - No "start" state or "final" states are given.
