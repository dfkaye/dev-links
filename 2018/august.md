+ Being Human Podcast - #23 [*Leaving Facebook – with **Kent Beck***](http://www.firsthuman.com/podcast/23-leaving-facebook-with-kent-beck/) - Kent was fired for being the one who wanted to point out the downsides to tech choices whereas FB's performance review process incentivizes promoting your "impact" (thus, only upsides). This is what growth-only companies do, because they fear hostile takeovers, market share reductions, etc., more than they fear the desctruction of everything.

    > First and foremost, server-side rendering is a better user experience compared to just client-side rendering. The user gets the content faster, the webpage is more accessible when JS fails or is disabled, and search engines have an easier time indexing it.
    > Secondly, it provides a better developer experience. Writing the same markup twice both on the server in your preferred templating library and in JavaScript can be tedious and hard to maintain. Hypernova lets you write all of your view code in a single place without having to sacrifice the user‘s experience.
